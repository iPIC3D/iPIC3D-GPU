# Update for FP32

Date: 2025 March 4

In this version, FP32 particle array is the default. The precision of particle, field, moment can be set in [cudaTypeDef.cuh](./src/include/CUDA/cudaTypeDef.cuh). For data analysis (DA), it runs every cycle, only histogram, GMM disabled. 

There's no any output, except for the 2 txt files under data.

However, some new developed commits were merged into this branch, too. Foe example, much CPU code was removed. Some unused macros like `CUDA_ON` was removed, as it's always on.


# Updated `scaling` branch for UMA architecture

Date: 2025 April 24

Changes: Based on 138b1 on old scaling, to solve the memory utilization problem on a physical UMA platform. Only the main particle array is updated to UMA style. 

In this version, the original Particle3D is only used for particle exchange(now named exchanePart), it holds a small buffer, like 0.1*nop. The real particle array is held by particleArrayCUDA, managing its creation, expansion(cudaMallocManaged, hipMalloc). However, the particle initialization, maxwellian is still in the Particle3D. So a method was added to Particle3D, to initialize the buffer held by paricleArrayCUDA.

There's no `part` in the c_Solver now, so some output and helper function were commented out. But the field output is still working, for verification purpose. Just uncomment the `KCode.WriteOutput(i);` in iPic3D.h.

## Usage

### Requirement
To install and run iPIC3D-GPU, you need: 
- CUDA/HIP compatible hardware, CUDA capabiliy 7.5 or higher 
- cmake, MPI(MPICH and OpenMPI are tested) and HDF5 (optional), C/C++ compiler supporting C++ 17 standard

**To meet the requirements of compatability between CUDA and compiler, it's recommended to use a relatively new compiler version e.g. GCC 12**

If you are on a super-computer or cluster, it's highly possible that you can use tools like `module` to change the compiler, MPI or libraries used.

### Get the code

Git clone this repository or download the zip file of default branch. For example:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/iPIC3D/iPIC3D-GPU.git iPIC3D-GPU
cd ./iPIC3D-GPU
```
Now you are in the project folder

### Build

- Create a build directory
``` shell
mkdir build && cd build
```
- Use `CMake` to generate the make files
``` shell
# use .. here because CMakeList.txt would be under project root 
cmake .. # using CUDA by default
cmake -DHIP_ON=ON .. # use HIP
```

If you's like to use HIP, notice the GPU architecture in [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt), change it according to your hardware to get bet performance:

``` cmake 
set_property(TARGET iPIC3Dlib PROPERTY HIP_ARCHITECTURES gfx90a) 
```


- Compile with `make` if successful, you will find an executable named `iPIC3D` in build directory
``` shell
make # you can use this single-threaded compile command, but slow
make -j4 # build with 4 threads
make -j # build with max threads, fast, recommended
```

### Run

iPIC3D uses inputfiles to control the simulation, we pass this text file as the only command line argument:

``` shell
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=2
mpirun -np 8 ./iPIC3D ../share/inputfiles/magneticReconnection/testGEM3Dsmall.inp
```

With this command, you are using 8 MPI ranks, 2 OpenMP threads per rank.

**Important:** make sure `number of MPI process = XLEN x YLEN x ZLEN` as specified in the input file.

**Critical:** OpenMP is enabled by default, make sure the number of thread every process is reasonable. Refer to [OpenMP](#openmp) for more details.

If you are on a super-computer, especially a multi-node system, it's likely that you should use `srun` to launch the program. 

#### Multi-node and Multi-GPU

Assigning MPI processes to nodes and GPUs are vital in performance, for it decides the pipeline and subdomains in the program.

It's fine to use more than 1 MPI process per GPU. The following example uses 4 nodes, each equipped with 4 GPU:

``` shell
# 1 MPI process per GPU
srun --nodes=4 --ntasks=16 --ntasks-per-node=4 ./iPIC3D ../share/benchmark/GEM3Dsmall_4x2x2_100/testGEM3Dsmall.inp 

# 2 MPI processes per GPU
srun --nodes=4 --ntasks=32 --ntasks-per-node=8 ./iPIC3D ../share/benchmark/GEM3Dsmall_4x4x2_100/testGEM3Dsmall.inp  
```


### Result

This iPIC3D-GPU will create folder (usually named `data`) for the output results if it doesn't exist. However, **it will delete everything in the folder if it already exits**.


## Build Options

### Debug

By default, the software is built with `Release` build type, which means highly optimized by the compiler. If you'd like to debug, use:

``` shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
```
instead, and you'll have `iPIC3D_d`. If you'd like to just have an unoptimized (slow) version:
``` shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Default ..
```

### OpenMP

In this iPIC3D-GPU, the Solver stays on the CPU side, which means the number of MPI process will not only affect the GPU but also the Solver's performance. 

To speedup the CPU part, the OpenMP is enabled by default:
``` shell
cmake .. # default

cmake -DUSE_OPENMP=OFF .. # if you'd like to disable OpenMP

# set OpenMP threads for each MPI process
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4
```
The solver on CPU will be benefited from OpenMP now, and this option is ON by default. It's important to control the number of threads per MPI process, make sure it's in a reasonable range.

## Tool

### Benchmark
In [benchmark](./share/benchmark/) folder, we prepared some scripts for profiling, please read the [benchmark/readme](./share/benchmark/readme.md) for more infomation.

There's a performance baseline file for your reference, 2 threads per process is used:

![GH200](./Documentation/image/GH200_release_baseline.png)

<!-- ![dual-A100](./Documentation/image/dual_A100_release_baseline.png) -->

You can find the corresponding data at [./share/benchmark/GH200_release_baseline.csv](./share/benchmark/GH200_release_baseline.csv).
 <!-- and [./benchmark/Dual-A100_release_baseline.csv](./benchmark/Dual-A100_release_baseline.csv).  -->

<!-- Please note that the `Particle` and `Moments` parts are not exactly the time consumption of these two parts, as the kernels are interwaved in this version. The sum of the two parts are precise, though. -->
